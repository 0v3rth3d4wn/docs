## Generating production ready assets

Generate production ready assets with `gulp --production`, which will build your assets without the source maps. 

If you use [Trellis](/trellis/), you can build your assets locally, then copy them to the remote server during deployment. [See the `build-before.yml` example hook](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/master/deploy-hooks/build-before.yml) in Trellis.
